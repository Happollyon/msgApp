# StealthComms â€” Concealed Messaging App

StealthComms is a secure and discreet messaging platform built for those who require high privacy standards in communication. Developed as part of my BSc (Hons) in Computing (Cybersecurity), this project features a hidden interface that can be disguised as a calculator, Tetris, or Snake game. The app combines robust security measures with a modern and user-friendly design.

## Development Workflow

The project is divided into two main stages:

### Pre-Authentication Stage
- User registration and email verification.
- Password setup with enforced security guidelines.

### Post-Authentication Stage
- Real-time chat and contact management.
- Profile updates, secure image uploads, and discreet notifications.

This modular approach ensures easy scalability and maintainability.

- Add support for self-destructing messages.
- Extend file sharing capabilities for additional document types.
- Integrate the Giphy API for dynamic image sharing.
- Expand the notification system with customizable alert settings.
